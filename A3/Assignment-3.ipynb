    "1. The gradient method often exhibits linear convergence, i.e., f is locally linear. The choice of backtracking parameters has a noticeable but not dramatic effect on the convergence. The convergence rate depends greatly on the condition number of the Hessian. When the condition number is 1000 or more, the gradient method is so slow that it is useless in practice. It is very simple but rarely used in practice due to slow convergence. Sometimes loss starts increasing if the learning rate is too high. If suppose initialization is not that good gradient is vanishingly small, then thereâ€™ll barely be any update to the weight. The gradient descent method is the steepest descent method for the Euclidean norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-convex nature of this error function makes iterative algorithms like gradient descent susceptible to poor Initialization or choice of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Rate:** While a higher learning rate makes the algorithm converge towards the minima faster, as shown by the figures, setting too high a learning rate causes the algorithm to misbehave and divergeâ€”this is because the algorithm tends to miss and overshoot the minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:** An initialization that is far from the actual minima can severely affect the algorithm's performance. Depending on the gradients around the initialization point, it can either slow the convergence rate or even cause the algorithm to get stuck in a different local minimum if the gradients point towards it instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Iterations:** From the figures, gradient descent takes larger leaps in the beginning and smaller ones as it closes in towards the minima. This stagnation means that although it still improves in each step, the improvements are minor and hence of not much significance after, in this case, 200 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fewer Observations:** The number of observations affects gradient descentâ€”as the quality of estimates and rate of convergence deteriorate with a decrease in the number of observations. A decrease in the number of observations flattens the cost function and reduces the gradientsâ€”making them difficult to follow for gradient descent."

    "2. The Gauss-Newton method and the Levenberg-Marquardt Method has several very strong advantages over the gradient and steepest descent methods, i. e., fast convergence (at most six iterations in the quadratic phase) and affine invariance: insensitive to the choice of coordinates Scales well with problem size (only a few more steps are necessary between $R^{100}$ and $R^{10000}$). The performance is not dependent on the choice of the algorithm parameters. The main disadvantage is the cost of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is the most widely used optimization algorithm. It outperforms simple gradient descent and other conjugate gradient methods in a wide variety of problems. Simple gradient descent suffers from various convergence problems. Logically, we would like to take large steps down the gradient at locations where the gradient is small and, conversely, take small steps when the gradient is large so as not to rattle out of the minima. With the above update rule, we do just the opposite of this. Another issue is that the curvature of the error surface may not be the same in all directions. This situation can be improved upon by using curvature as well as gradient information, namely second derivatives. The main advantage of this technique is rapid convergence. However, the rate of convergence is sensitive to the starting location. Levenberg proposed an algorithm based on this observation, whose update rule is a blend of both the algorithms. It is to be noted that while the LM method is in no way optimal but is just a heuristic, it works extremely well in practice. The only flaw is its need for matrix inversion as part of the update. Even though the inverse is usually implemented using clever pseudo-inverse methods such as singular value decomposition, the cost of the update becomes prohibitive after the model size increases to a few thousand parameters. However, this method is much faster than vanilla gradient descent for moderately sized models (of a few hundred parameters). While optimizing a non-linear least-squares formulation, we linearise the cost function in the neighborhood of our current estimate, using the gradients to estimate the next guess. While gradient descent moves in the opposite direction of the gradient, Gauss-Newton uses the closed-form solution of the locally-linear least-squares approximation to arrive at the next estimate. Levenberg-Marquardt balances these two approaches using a damping factor, which also imparts numerical stability by ensuring that the matrix is fully rank and, hence, invertible. We start with and decrease it by a factor of  10 every time the loss decreases and making it ten times every time the loss increases. This causes Levenberg-Marquardt to follow the gradients when it is far away from the minima by increasing the gradient-descent-like character, and quickly move towards the minima of the local curvature when it is closer to the minima by increasing the Gauss-Newton-like character of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initialization:** Both gradient descent and Gauss-Newton fail to estimate the parameters correctly when the Initialization is not close to the actual minima. Following the curvature takes Gauss-Newton to a different local minimum. Hence its estimates are off by a huge amount. Gradient descent, despite producing an even higher cost, makes an estimate closer to the actual. However, it is unable to converge in a limited number of iterations. Levenberg-Marquardt, which initially follows the gradient to move in the right direction and then follows the curvature to converge quickly, is the only one that can estimate the parameters accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Iterations:** Both Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt converge much quicker than gradient-descent. This is because they move to the minima of the local approximation of the function in each iteration instead of just moving along the gradient by a constant amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fewer Observations:** While both Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt are resilient to a fewer number of observations, gradient descent's performance gets adversely affected. This is because a decrease in the number of observations flattens the cost function and decreases the gradientsâ€”making it difficult for gradient descent to converge quickly (see figure below, compared to the one above on the same scale)."
