    "1. Why is an Octomap memory efficient?\n",
    "2. When do we update an Octomap and why?\n",
    "3. When would you likely use an octomap instead of a point cloud?\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## Solutions:\n",
    "Ans 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Octomap is an open source framework that creates 3D occupancy grids (based on the octree data structure) with robotics and mapping techniques written in C++. It combines individual points to produce an ideally compressed occupancy map with the least amount of memory use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Octomap is a volumetric 3D environment containing unknown and free zones, as well as a probabilistic occupancy estimate for the 3D grid map. The environment is reduced to only a few bits per child node while retaining the essential distinction between occupied, unoccupied, and unknown cells, decreasing the amount of memory required. The technique for the same limitations for volume confidence to ensure a lossless compression method while reducing memory consumption considerably. As a result, octomap saves memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* According to the octree data structure, we only expand the data to the partially occupied node(into 8 childs) (or we could say partially unoccupied). We don't create children for nodes that have a strong belief in being entirely occupied or a high believe in being totally vacant. Giving a data structure that is memory efficient and allows for a compact memory representation and multi-resolution map searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "* We can keep updating the map with new sensor readings, however the initial point clouds aren't preserved (but can be stored). Because of the noise inherent in the monitoring of the environment, a given box may be identified as \"occupied\" in one block and \"unoccupied\" in another. \"Occupied\" is more frequently used; \"unemployed\" is more frequently used. It might be related to the space's dynamic characteristics (e.g., removing the table), but it could also be due to noise (most of the time).\n",
    "* At any time, new data or sensor readings can be uploaded. Modeling and updating are done probabilistically. Sensor noise or readings, for example, might occur as a result of dynamic objects arising from dynamic environmental changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Furthermore, several robots can work on the same map and expand the previous map while exploring new places. We just search and update the node for storage reduction and environmental or node information if we find a partially-occupied cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 3.\n",
    "* OctoMap is an open-source Octree framework that is known for its memory efficiency for representing 3D environments. However, the map format for point clouds is not compact. Point cloud maps include a lot of unnecessary information and are typically very big, resulting in a large pcd file. One 640 by 480 picture creates 300,000 points, which takes up a lot of space when it comes to recording finer details like patterns and wrinkles on the carpet.\n",
    "* A point cloud is insufficient to deal with overlap. When we create a point cloud, we instantly put together the estimated position. If the posture is incorrect, the map will visibly overlap. A computer screen, for example, has become two and the original border has become a polygon. It is necessary to improve the treatment of the overlapping region.\n",
    "* Since OctoMap is a 3D occupancy grid mapping and may be used for flying robots' 3D route schemes and various robots equipped with handlers, point cloud cannot be utilised for robot navigation."
